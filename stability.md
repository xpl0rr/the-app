# Looper App Stability Improvements

## Code Audit Findings
- Removed unnecessary `console.log` debug statements from `index.tsx` and `VideoEditor.tsx`
- Identified and removed commented-out imports for missing components
- Found inconsistent file naming (e.g., `two.tsx` as SavedClipsScreen)
- Detected interface inconsistencies in `SavedVideo` interface
- Identified import path inconsistencies (absolute vs relative paths)

## Code Cleanup Actions
- Removed all debug console.log statements
- Normalized import paths to use relative paths consistently
- Renamed `two.tsx` to `saved-clips.tsx` for clarity
- Updated tab navigation in `_layout.tsx` to use new file names
- Expanded `SavedVideo` interface with missing properties
- Added proper null checks in `saveClip` function
- Updated explore screen with relevant app content

## Stability Improvements
- Added `ErrorBoundary` component for catching runtime errors
- Created `SafeWebView` component with error handling and auto-retry
- Implemented input validation utilities in `validation.ts`
- Added iOS-specific error handlers in `iOSErrorHandlers.ts`
- Added defensive string handling for malformed `video.title` values
- Added checks for `currentVideo && currentVideo.id` to prevent null reference errors
- Fixed YouTube player API access errors with proper ready state checks
- Enhanced deep link handling through `deepLinks.ts`
- Added network status monitoring for offline scenarios
- Added global error handler to catch unhandled exceptions

## State Management
- Added `AppSettingsContext` for centralized settings management
- Implemented settings persistence with AsyncStorage
- Added user preference controls via settings screen

## Performance Optimizations
- Created memoized video item component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added memory warning handling for iOS
- Improved YouTube player control functions with caching and try-catch blocks

## Testing Support
- Added mock utilities for unit testing in `testHelpers.ts`
- Added App Store review prompt timing logic
